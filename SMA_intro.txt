### **What is Social Media Analytics?**

Social Media Analytics (SMA) refers to the process of **collecting, measuring, analyzing, and interpreting data** from social media platforms to support decision-making. It helps in understanding how people interact with content, what trends are emerging, and how brands or topics are being perceived online.

This involves analyzing both **quantitative metrics** (likes, shares, comments, reach) and **qualitative insights** (sentiment, customer opinions, topic trends). It turns social media activity into valuable data that organizations can use to improve strategies, campaigns, and engagement.
